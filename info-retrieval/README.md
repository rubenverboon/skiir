Only uses [AlchemyAPI](http://www.alchemyapi.com/) and [DBPedia](http://www.dbpedia.org) for now. 
You will require AlchemyAPI, a (my) key for it and it requires some PHP for now.
I've looked to see if I could make cross-domain requests from an extension: this is only `GET`, not `POST`, it seems. 
If any of you know more than I do, feel free to inform me.

Here is the 'get started' for AlchemyAPI:  
[Getting started with AlchemyAPI](http://www.alchemyapi.com/developers/getting-started-guide)

And my key:  
1c58231155c34192a1c2b8d945deebbefa641605  
This has a limited amount of uses per day. 

Place the 'home.php' on you localhost. popup.js has a hardcoded local url, check that if you have problems.
