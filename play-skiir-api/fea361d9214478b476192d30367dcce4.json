Since 2010, Total has divested interests in 11 onshore Nigerian blocks to local companies. \n“These transactions also reduce our exposure to non-operated blocks onshore Nigeria, and allow us to focus on our core, operated developments, such as the Egina project,” Chief Financial Officer Patrick de La Chevardiere said in the statement. \nTotal Chief Executive Officer Patrick Pouyanne has said he will curb spending and quicken the pace of asset sales after the price of crude oil crashed to six-year lows. The company wants to raise $5 billion through disposals this year, and is targeting a total of $10 billion through 2017. \nTo contact the reporter on this story: Tara Patel in Paris at  tpatel2@bloomberg.net \nTo contact the editors responsible for this story: Will Kennedy at  wkennedy3@bloomberg.net Ana Monteiro, Randall Hackley \n","entities":[{"type":"Company","relevance":"0.818789","count":"2","text":"Total","disambiguated":{"subType":["CompanyShareholder"],"name":"Total S.A.","website":"http://www.total.com","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Total_S.A.","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.03d938","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Total_S.A."}},{"type":"FieldTerminology","relevance":"0.750912","count":"2","text":"oil company"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.687538","count":"1","text":"Chief Financial Officer Patrick de La Chevardiere"},{"type":"Company","relevance":"0.67992","count":"2","text":"OML"},{"type":"Company","relevance":"0.641899","count":"1","text":"Nigerian Oil Mining"},{"type":"JobTitle","relevance":"0.536359","count":"1","text":"Chief Executive Officer"},{"type":"FieldTerminology","relevance":"0.533449","count":"1","text":"crude oil"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.504837","count":"2","text":"Patrick Pouyanne"},{"type":"Company","relevance":"0.457126","count":"1","text":"Bloomberg","disambiguated":{"subType":[],"name":"Bloomberg L.P.","website":"http://www.bloomberg.com","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bloomberg_L.P.","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.027sm6","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Bloomberg_L.P."}},{"type":"City","relevance":"0.452349","count":"1","text":"Aiteo Eastern E&P"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.435763","count":"1","text":"Tara Patel"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.427778","count":"1","text":"Randall Hackley"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.424695","count":"1","text":"Will Kennedy"},{"type":"Person","relevance":"0.424528","count":"1","text":"Ana Monteiro"},{"type":"Country","relevance":"0.418072","count":"1","text":"Nigeria","disambiguated":{"subType":["Location","GovernmentalJurisdiction","BoardMember"],"name":"Nigeria","geo":"9.066666666666666 7.483333333333333","dbpedia":"http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nigeria","freebase":"http://rdf.freebase.com/ns/m.05cgv","ciaFactbook":"http://www4.wiwiss.fu-berlin.de/factbook/resource/Nigeria","opencyc":"http://sw.opencyc.org/concept/Mx4rvViCTJwpEbGdrcN5Y29ycA","yago":"http://yago-knowledge.org/resource/Nigeria"}},{"type":"Continent","relevance":"0.381895","count":"1","text":"Europe"},{"type":"JobTitle","relevance":"0.374169","count":"1","text":"reporter"},{"type":"City","relevance":"0.349968","count":"1","text":"Paris"},{"type":"EmailAddress","relevance":"0.349968","count":"1","text":"wkennedy3@bloomberg.net"},{"type":"EmailAddress","relevance":"0.349968","count":"1","text":"tpatel2@bloomberg.net"},{"type":"Quantity","relevance":"0.349968","count":"1","text":"$569 million"},{"type":"Quantity","relevance":"0.349968","count":"1","text":"$10 billion"},{"type":"Quantity","relevance":"0.349968","count":"1","text":"$1 billion"},{"type":"Quantity","relevance":"0.349968","count":"1","text":"$5 billion"},{"type":"Quantity","relevance":"0.349968","count":"1","text":"six-year"}]}
